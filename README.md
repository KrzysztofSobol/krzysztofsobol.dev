# 🌐 CV Website

A personal CV website built with **Java Spring Boot** and **React**, featuring a **pure CSS design** (no libraries) and a **dynamic map generation algorithm** (wave function collapse) running on the backend.

## 🎯 Highlights
- 💻 Fullstack application with Spring Boot and React
- 🖌️ Pure CSS styling (no frameworks or libraries)
- 🗺️ Dynamic map generation using a custom wave function collapse algorithm
- 🎨 Canvas-based map painting and smooth animation
- 🐳 Docker Compose for easy local deployment

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Backend**: Java Spring Boot
- **Frontend**: React + Pure CSS

## 🌄 Hero Section
The `Heropage` component generates the map and handles the canvas-based animation. It dynamically paints the map, simulates water waves, and allows users to generate new map configurations.

### Key Functionalities:
- Observes canvas visibility to control animation performance
- Pre-renders static terrain on an offscreen canvas
- Animates water tiles with a sine wave effect

---
